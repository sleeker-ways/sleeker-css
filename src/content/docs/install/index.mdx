## Install

Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework.

You can install sleekerCSS to your project using the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm create sleeker-css
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm create sleeker-css
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn create sleeker-css
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will install `sleeker-css` and adds the config file to the root of your project.
