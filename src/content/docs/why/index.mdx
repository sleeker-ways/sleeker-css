## The Problem

Among all the ways you can style your website, using a utility-class framwork (like tailwindCSS, UnoCSS , ... )  has huge benfits.

Actually we think its the best way (in most cases) and dived deep [comparing all the ways to style a website here](/why/css-approaches).

But, the utility-class frameworks can do better.

current farameowrks are not going into that direction, and that's why we created SleekerCSS.


## Philosophy

SleekerCSS is built we a mindset or philosophy in mind, which is the result of our experience with other toolings.

In fact, for that reason, the syntax and API where designed first, after that implimentation was done.

Here we want to share our mindset with you. 

- Shorter Utility Class Names ⇒ Cleaner and More Readable Markup
- No Random Class Names, Consnstent and Pattern-based Naming for Classes based on CSS syntax ⇒ Read and Guess class names without docs
- Modern CSS features ⇒ Apps for 2023
    - Container Query + Media Query
    - Logical Perperties (padding-inline, …)
- No Cancelation, No side effect handling. Just building on top, one rule at a time
- CSS Variables naming aligned with class names
- No JSON Config file, CSS is you Config File
    - you can’t make the syntax completly different
- Create Composed classes on the fly, without config, css, or anything
    - `<button class='btn=[ pi1 pb3 r1 ] '>my button</button> `
- base on best practices
    - using `rem` for media queries by default, to account for font increase in browser setting.
- `Rem` is primary unit. ⇒ no math on your head.
    - This might be removed as we use a lot of `0.5rem` and `0.75rem` in the markup and its ugly.
    - But at the same time, for larger numbers the math is cumbersome, like `@w>100` you need to do math `100 / 4 = 25rem` in your head
- giving all control to developers
    - no oponiated `sm:` or forcing mobile first.

## Solution


## Inspiration 





## SleekerCSS vs TailwindCSS

shorter classnames for mist used claases
long format for least used properties
easier to understand with columns

no bad practice inside included

Meaning full paddings
In sync with border-radiuses

harmonic colors (dont wait for lch)

configure with css variables

ITCSS compatible
CUBECSS compatible

Logical syntax
Don't worry about @layer

No @apply bad practice

Your way to create exceptions

Tailwind compatible (no single classname colides!!!)

Accessible fluid typography

No media query needed. Everything is fluid

Dark mode built in the colours, but also customizable!

Can read configuration from your tailwind
