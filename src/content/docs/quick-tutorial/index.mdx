In Sleeker there is only one way to apply a rule. 

SleekerCSS tries to stick to CSS syntaxt as much as possible. But we all know CSS keywords are long, so we need to make them short.

## Most Used Classes

Sleeker CSS has shortest names fir things are most used:

| Rule    | Class |
| -------- | ------- |
| padding: 1rem;  | p1  |
| margin-inline-start: -0.5rem | mis-.5  |
| border-width: 1px | b1px |
| border-radius: 0.75 | r.75 |
| width: 1em | w1em |
| color: var(--_red) | c_red |
| color: red | c[red] |
| color: red | c_[red] |

`rem` is the default unit. So a number without a unit is a rem number.
Other rules that have versy short names.

- height -> h
- color -> c
- background-color -> bg
- border-color -> bc
- outline-color -> oc
- outline-w -> ow
